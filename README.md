# A hobby website for audio visualization meant for testing 3D website with Virtual Reality technology enabled.
The website works best with an Oculus Quest and its controllers.

* The right controller select button is in charge of interacting with interactable objects / other actions in the 3D space
* The left controller select button is in charge of looping, starting and pausing songs
* Use the right controller joystick to move forward / backwards, and left / right relative to the direction your camera is facing
* Use the left controller joystick to move up or down vertically on the y-axis of your VR Body

## Please note that the code is not written in the best, optimized / clean way so its not a proper convention to follow for projects
